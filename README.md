# simple-Vi-Editor
using stack implementation, I worked on creating a simple program similar to a Vi Editor which allows you to edit text files
the way you want. In this program one is able to move around the text file, aswell as produce undo futures to the file through
deleting characters, words, and even full lines in a text and being able to put them back using a stack on the undo future.
